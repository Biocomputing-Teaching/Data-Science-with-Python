        abstract = {In the past decade, the emergence of machine learning (ML) applications has led to significant advances towards implementation of personalised medicine approaches for improved health care, due to the exceptional performance of ML models when utilising complex big data. The immune-mediated chronic inflammatory diseases are a group of complex disorders associated with dysregulated immune responses resulting in inflammation affecting various organs and systems. The heterogeneous nature of these diseases poses great challenges for tailored disease management and addressing unmet patient needs. Applying novel ML techniques to the clinical study of chronic inflammatory diseases shows promising results and great potential for precision medicine applications in clinical research and practice. In this review, we highlight the clinical applications of various ML techniques for prediction, diagnosis and prognosis of autoimmune rheumatic diseases, inflammatory bowel disease, autoimmune chronic kidney disease, and multiple sclerosis, as well as ML applications for patient stratification and treatment selection. We highlight the use of ML in drug development, including target identification, validation and drug repurposing, as well as challenges related to data interpretation and validation, and ethical concerns related to the use of artificial intelligence in clinical research.},

Although ROC graphs are apparently simple, there are some common misconceptions and pitfalls when using them in practice. The purpose of this article is to serve as an introduction to ROC graphs and as a guide for using them in research.},
